## Description

The Maze Solver Game is an engaging visual tool that lets players experiment with and learn about four fundamental pathfinding algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), A*, and Bidirectional Search Algorithms. Designed as a grid-based puzzle, the game allows users to create mazes and observe how each algorithm navigates them in real time.
